Analysis of Breast Cancer Data

The goal of this project was to carry out analysis of a dataset of my choice.

My chosen dataset was obtained from an open source website Kaggle. It contained information on patients who had been diagnosed with various stages of breast cancer. I focussed on the Age, Gender, Tumour_Stage, Surgery_Type, Histology, Patient_Status columns. The goal of this analysis was to determine if Women are at a higher risk and more often diagnosed with breast cancer than Men which is commonly believed and also supported by several studies, (Ly et al., 2013), through my research.
